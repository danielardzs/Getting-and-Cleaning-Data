run_analysis.R prepares data to be analyzed followed by 5 steps to make it look tidy:
  1. Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Labels the data set with descriptive names
  5. From data in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable, for each            activity for each subject

CodeBook.md is a code book that describes variables and transformation performed to clean up data the data

BigData.txt is the final exported file after going through all the steps described above
